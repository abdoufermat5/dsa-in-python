# Data structures and algorithms in Python

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python from the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael/dp/1118290275) by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.

It is intended to be a learning resource for myself and others, and as such, the implementations are not necessarily the most efficient or Pythonic. I have also included some of the exercises from the book.
